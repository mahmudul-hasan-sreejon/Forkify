# Forkify

Recipe web application for kitchen hobbyists and beginner cooks. Search through thousands of recipes for cooking instructions and ingredients; save your favorite recipes via local storage.

This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as `Webpack` to bundle the modules, and `Babel` to convert `ES6`, `ES7` and `ES8` back to `ES5`, and several npm modules to function the app properly. It uses a simple `Express` server in order to run in `Heroku`.

This app can be found [here](https://forkify-mhs.herokuapp.com/).
