# Forkify

Recipe web application for kitchen hobbyists and beginner cooks. Search through thousands of recipes for cooking instructions and ingredients; save your favorite recipes via local storage.

This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle the modules, and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to convert `ES6`, `ES7` and `ES8` back to `ES5`, and several npm modules to function the app properly. It uses a simple [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) server in order to run on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
